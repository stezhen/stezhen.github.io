        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h6>Task Analysis</h6>
            <p>Based on research conducted online and in-person interviews, I first focused on defining the problem space for mobility disabilities. Then, as a group, we pieced together our individual insights to synthesize a larger and more general problem statement analysis. </p>
            <p>In doing so, we narrowed down the scope to clothing because everybody needs it and the body directly impacts clothing decisions.

        <h6>Interviews</h6>
        <p>While conducting interviews for defining the problem space, I discovered: </p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>People generally do not know what they want </p></li>
            <li><p>Fashion is rooted in ableism </p></li>
            <li><p>Companies and designers can be afraid of specially designing for specific bodies out of the fear that their designs will face backlash for inaccuracy.</p></li>
            <li><p>The concept of disabilities is created and perpetuated by society</p></li>
        </ol>
            <p>
            When conducting interviews to design the solution, I discovered: </p>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Many solutions focus on an “empathetic model” and not on empowerment, which can further alienate people with disabilities</p></li>
            <li><p>Many major labels have disability clothing lines but they are not well-known and advertised</p></li>
            <li><p>Narrow Down Specific Student Groups to Problem Solve for</p></li>
            <li><p>The difference between Blind Disabilities vs. Visible Disabilities</p></li>
            <li><p>Disabilities affect how someone interacts with people and the environment</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h6>User Personas</h6>
            <p>Using research and interview insights, I defined two sample target groups: Mary, a working mother trying to buy adaptive clothing for her son, and Sam, a man with MS looking to buy adaptive clothing for himself. These user personas allow me to empathize with the user’s story and humanize their needs for the design.</p>

        <!--<h6>Journey Mapping</h6>-->

    <div class = "project-section">
        <h2>First Iteration</h2>

        <h6>Brainstorming</h6>
            <p>Our first solution had two aspects, a physical exhibition for the annual Medium Raw Exp and a functional website. The Physical Exhibition would be used to demonstrate what the website does in real life and give the user an “in-person experience”. The exhibit would raise awareness for the issue in our community and the website would display the solution.</p>
            <p>I focused on the exhibition experience and narrowed down the solution to providing solvency and awareness for dexterity and prosthetic disabilities, sizing issues, and orthotic footwear.</p>
        <h6>2D - Rendering</h6>
            <p>As a low-fidelity prototype for the exhibit, I created 2D-Renderings on my iPad to show the storymap. </p>

            <p>Our group then recieved feedback at our club, Medium Design Collective's first critique with four Cornell Professors and approximately 50 attendees.</p>
            <p>Key Insights:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Focus on either awareness or clothing finding</p></li>
                <li><p>Ensure the try-on experience does not essentializing the experience of the disabled</p></li>
                <li><p>Focus on one body type and disability first - trying to provide solvency for multiple problems at once is too difficult.</p></li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Second Iteration</h2>

        <h6>Brainstorming</h6>
            <p>The exhibit was still too broad of a focus and disconnected to the website.
                So, we decided to go back to basics and conduct more research. In addition, I realized the exhibit might have a negative connotation by invoking pity for disabled people instead of empowering them.</p>
            <p>We decided to narrow our scope, cutting out the exhibit entirely and focusing only on the website to provide solvency.</p>
         
        <h6>User Flow</h6>
        <p>We mapped out the structure using a user flow diagram to map out the search process. </p>
